# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Week-4-Assignment
contains run_analysis.R file and CodeBook.md file to describe variables present within the dataset
A few notes if assessing the code:
1. Please make sure all librarys listed at the top of the .R file are installed and loaded if attempting to running main body of code
2. It might help to run the sequentially (from top to bottom) as some later variables rely on code generated beforehand.
3. I have set working directories based on my own working computer and stored them in variables for ease of use
4. I found that naming the variables at an earlier stage allowed me to sort data by mean and standard deviation more easily with no noticable impact on the final tidy dataset.
5. Code could be further optimised with chaining some commands together. However, it works equally well without chaining.
